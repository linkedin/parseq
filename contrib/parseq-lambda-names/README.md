Parseq Lambda Names
==========================

This project aims to provide more meaningful default descriptions for Parseq tasks. Using ASM, it tries to locate where
lambda expression is defined in source code and also infer some details about its execution like function call within
lambda expression with number of arguments.

How to use
==========================

The shaded jar of parseq-lambda-names should be present on classpath along with parseq jar in order to analyze
generated Lambda classes one time during application launch.

Limitations
==========================

As this project uses ASM to analyze generated bytecode, it can potentially break between minor JVM versions. Currently
its tested for jvm versions: 1.8.0_5, 1.8.0_40, 1.8.0_72
