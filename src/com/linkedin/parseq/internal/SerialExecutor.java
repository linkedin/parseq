/**
 * An executor that provides the following guarantees:
 * <p>
 * 1. Only one Runnable may be executed at a time
 * 2. The completion of a Runnable happens-before the execution of the next Runnable
 * <p>
 * For more on the happens-before constraint see the {@code java.util.concurrent}
 * package documentation.
 * <p>
 * It is possible for the underlying executor to throw an exception signaling
 * that it is not able to accept new work. For example, this can occur with an
 * executor that has a bounded queue size and an
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy}. If this occurs
 * the executor will run the {@code rejectionHandler} to signal this failure
 * to a layer that can more appropriate handle this event.

  /*
   * Below is a proof and description of a mechanism that ensures that
   * "completion of a Runnable happens-before the execution of the next Runnable".
   * Let's call the above proposition P from now on.
   *
   * A Runnable can only be executed by tryExecuteLoop. tryExecuteLoop makes sure that
   * there is a happens-before relationship between the current thread that executes
   * tryExecuteLoop and the execution of the next Runnable. Lets call this property HB.
   *
   * tryExecuteLoop can be invoked in two ways:
   *
   * 1) Recursively from within the ExecutorLoop.run method after completion of a Runnable
   * on a thread belonging to the underlying executor.
   * In this case HB ensures that P is true.
   *
   * 2) Through the SerialExecutor.execute method on an arbitrary thread.
   * There are two cases:
   * a) The submitted Runnable is the first Runnable executed by this SerialExecutor. In this case P is trivially true.
   * b) The submitted Runnable is not the first Runnable executed by this SerialExecutor. In this case the thread that executed
   * the last runnable, after it's completion, must have invoked _pendingCount.decrementAndGet, and got 0. Since the
   * thread executing SerialExecutor.execute invoked _pendingCount.getAndIncrement, and got the value 0, it means
   * that there is a happens-before relationship between the thread completing last Runnable and the current thread
   * executing SerialExecutor.execute. Combined with HB1 this means that P is true.
