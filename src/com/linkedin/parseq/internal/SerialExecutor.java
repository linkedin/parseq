/**
 * An executor that provides the following guarantees:
 * <p/>
 * 1. Only one task may be executed at a time
 * 2. The completion of a task happens-before the execution of the next task
 * <p/>
 * For more on the happens-before constraint see the {@code java.util.concurrent}
 * package documentation.
 * <p/>
 * It is possible for the underlying executor to throw an exception signaling
 * that it is not able to accept new work. For example, this can occur with an
 * executor that has a bounded queue size and an
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy}. If this occurs
 * the executor will run the {@code rejectionHandler} to signal this failure
 * to a layer that can more appropriate handle this event.
