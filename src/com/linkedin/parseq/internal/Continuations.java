/**
 * This class allows running the following code structure:
 * <pre><code>
 * method() {
 *   action1()
 *   ...
 *   actionN()
 * }
 * </code></pre>
 * such that {@code actionX} can throw exception or recursively call {@code method}
 * multiple times, without worry about stack overflow.
 * <p>
 * The guarantee is that actions are called in the same order that recursive approach
 * would have called them. To put it in another way, this class guarantees to traversal the
 * execution tree in pre-order.
 * <p>
 * You can imagine recursive invocations as walking an execution tree in DFS order where
 * order of visiting children of a tree matters. This class implements DFS walk
 * in such a way that used stack is not proportional to the tree height, instead used heap
 * is proportional to the tree height.
